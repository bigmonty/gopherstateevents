	<h4 class="h4">How to Use This Site: Cross-Country Meet Director</h4>
	
	<p>The GSE© web portal for managing cross-country meets is designed to make the process of managing meets managed by GSE© a clean and 
	streamlined process.  It should be noted that, for those that are not comfortable navigating web sites, you may also choose to manage your 
	meet(s) via <a href="mailto:bob.schneider@gopherstateevents.com">email</a>.</p>

			To manage one of your meets scored by GSE©, select the meet that you want to manage from the 
			"Select Meet" dropdown on your home page.  From here you will be able to manage the basic meet data, the
			races included in this meet, and the teams participating in the meet.  Specific instructions for these tasks are
