            Gopher State Events has made a near-complete move from paper to digital communication with meet directors, coaches, and athletes.  (We will 
            still be printing pursuit line-ups and other necessary documentation in Nordic Ski pursuit events.)  Below is what we are doing to make this 
            new approach "work" for you as a coach.

            <h5 class="h5 bg-info">Confirming Your Line-Up:</h5>
            Once all line-ups for a meet have been submitted or the line-up deadline passes, you will receive a line-up confirmation email that you 
            can use to make changes prior to the meet.  This allows us the ability to fix things before we get on-site so we can keep our on-site 
            focus to timing the event.

            We provide meet directors with a very clean digital results display and, if needed, a tablet to display those results on.  We can also
            provide a hotspot for internet access if needed.

            <h5 class="h5 bg-danger">Checking Results Accuracy:</h5>
            While we don't print and post results any more, we realize that it is important to be able to check RFID results for accuracy prior to
            awards and/or advancement determination.  Here are the options we have implemented for this:

            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">Notifying Coaches During The Meet
                    <ul class="list-group">
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            Head coaches are automatically sent a results email indicating their individual participant results shortly after each race.
                            However, while this may be marginally helpful, we realize that coaches have more to do than check their email during a meet, so...
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Notifying Staff/Managers During The Meet
                    <ul class="list-group">
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            Coaches can add staff members and student managers to their team staff and designate that they also receive these notifications.
                            This is done under the team staff menu item in your portal.  Just assign an assistant or student manager to check race results
                            shortly after all kids have finished.

                            We put results online and we encourage meet announcers to announce to spectators to check gopherstateevents.com for results
                            during the meet.  If an athlete is missed, a spectator (parent?) will often notice that and communicate the omission to the 
                            coaching staff.
                        </li>

                            Finally, we have just released the beta version of <a href="http://www.gopherstateevents.com/cc_meet/perf_trkr/login.asp">Performance Tracker</a>.
                            This is an athletes-only utility designed for tracking the performances of themselves, teammates, and competitors.  It also
                            allows them to sign up for email and text message notification of their results.  They can also have their results sent to
                            their "followers" (parents, friends, etc.)
