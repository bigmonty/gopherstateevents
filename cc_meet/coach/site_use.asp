	<h4 class="h4 bg-success">How to Use This Site: Cross-Country/Nordic Coach</h4>
	
	<p>The GSE web portal for managing cross-country & nordic meets is designed to make the process of participating in meets managed by GSE a clean and 
	streamlined process.</p>
	
    <div class="bg-info">
        <h5 class="h5">Uploading a new roster:</h5>
        <p>
            You may upload a new roster at any time.  Students that appear to be in the system already will not be uploaded and, if 
			it is not a duplicate entry, the student's name can be modified slightly and entered individually.
        </p>
    </div>
	
    <div class="bg-warning">
        <h5 class="h5">Adding/Deleting/Editing/Archiving roster members:</h5>
        <p>
            You may edit your roster by selecting "Manage Roster" on the vertical menu and then selecting the team whose roster you want 
			to edit in the "Select Team" dropdown on the vertical menu.
        </p>

        <h5 class="h5">Submitting/Editing Your Meet Line-Up:</h5>
        <p>
            Your "Meet Line-Up" is just a designation of which race your participants are running.  It is imperative that you submit an ACCURATE meet 
            line-up for every GSE meet that your team participates in.  The lineup must be in by 7:00 AM the day before for the meet, or earlier
            if the meet logistics dictate.  Subject to meet management approval, a limited number of changes can be made at the meet site.
        </p>
        <p>
            To designate your meet line-up, select the "Meets/Line-ups" link on the vertical menu.  On the ensuing page select the team
			and the meet that you are prepping for.  Then just select the radio button next to each kids' name under the race they are running.
			In the case of Nordic meets you also must enter a bib name.
