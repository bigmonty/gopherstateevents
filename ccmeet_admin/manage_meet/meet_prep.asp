	<p>Preparing packets for a GSE Cross-Country meet involves the following steps:</p>
	
	<dl>
		<dt>Print Coach/Team Labels</dt>
			<dd>These are placed on the upper left corner of the packets for team identification purposes.  See the link on the nav bar for this.</dd>
		<dt>Assign Bibs</dt>
			<dd>Open the "Teams" link and click on "Assign All Missing" under "Batch Assign Bibs".  You can check to see that this was done by
			clicking on the "Line-Ups" link and ensuring that all participants on all teams have bib numbers and that they are in sequence.  If you
			wish you can "Remove All" and re-do the process but this should never be done once the printing process has begun.</dd>
		<dt>Email Coaches Their Line-Ups</dt>
			<dd>Click "Line-Up Confirm", select each team, and click "Send Confirmations."  This will send each coach their line-ups and help avoid
			on-site line-up changes by letting coaches make changes via email prior to leaving for the meet.</dd>
		<dt>Print Line-Ups and Insert Into Team Packets</dt>
			<dd>Click the "Line-Ups" link and print.  This will generate a list for each team with a page break after each team.</dd>
		<dt>Generate Bib List</dt>
			<dd>Click the"Bib List" link and it will create a tab-delimited text document for the bibs for this meet.  Print a copy of that and then
			save it to your computer.  Then close the window, open the text file, and change it into an excel file to use for the MS Word Mail Merge.</dd>
		<dt>Prep Bibs</dt>
			<dd>Create a mail merge document for the bib labels, print them, and insert the correct bibs into each team's envelope.</dd>
